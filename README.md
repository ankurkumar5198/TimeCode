# TimeCode: Time Complexity Analyzer

TimeCode is a web-based tool that analyzes the time complexity of pseudo-code. It provides a simple interface for users to input their code and receive an estimated Big-O notation along with a visual representation of the complexity.

## Features

- User-friendly interface for inputting pseudo-code
- Instant analysis of time complexity
- Visual graph representation of the complexity
- Responsive design for various screen sizes

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Chart.js for graph visualization
